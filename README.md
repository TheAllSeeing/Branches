This is my final 5-point project for Software engineering — a somewhat basic task management android app meant for big multi-team projects, and specifically FRC teams.

**This is a snapshot of my part in a bigger project: If you wish to see the history of this repositry, you can look at the encompassing application, made for my robotics team: [Treetop](https://github.com/EverGreen7112/Treetop)**


## Main Features

**Personal Accound & Cloud Storage:** Sign up with an email or passsword or with your google account. Your data will be kept on the cloud and syhnchronized with any device you'll connect to.

**Unit Management:** You can create units to unify users under specific goals. Moreso, in order to outline your team more thoroughly, you can create subunits, and subsubunits, and so on in recursion in-finite.

**Goal Management:** Create detailed goals for your units and prioritize them on 5 color-coded levels. Sort them by completion status and the units they belong to.

**Task Management:** Outline your path to achieve each goal with tasks — also prioritized, and including deadlines for starting and ending work, and keeping assignees and assigners. You can detail each task you have even more, with unlimited subtasks, each can be as complex as its parent, and can have subtasks of its own,*Branching* (eh?) out to infinity. You can also automatically write the tasks to your system calendar, for easy synchronization.

**Notes:** When something comes up that does not yet amount to a task, or that you don't have the time to detail, take quick and dirty notes. You can take text notes, pick images from your gallery or (excluding Android 11), take a photo on the spot!
